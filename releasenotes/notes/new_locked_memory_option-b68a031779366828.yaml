    Add new ``hw:locked_memory`` extra spec and ``hw_locked_memory`` image
    property to lock memory on libvirt guest. Locking memory marks the guest
    memory allocations as unmovable and unswappable.
    ``hw:locked_memory`` extra spec and ``hw_locked_memory`` image property
    accept boolean values in string format like 'Yes' or 'false' value.
    Exception `LockMemoryForbidden` will raise, if you set lock memory value
    but not set either flavor extra spec
    ``hw:mem_page_size`` or image property ``hw_mem_page_size``,
    so we can ensure that the scheduler can actually account for this correctly
    and prevent out of memory events.
