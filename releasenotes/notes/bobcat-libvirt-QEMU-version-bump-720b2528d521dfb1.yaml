    The minimum required version of libvirt by the `nova-compute`
    service is now 7.0.0, and the minimum required version of QEMU is
    5.2.0. Failing to meet these minimum versions when using the libvirt
    compute driver will result in the `nova-compute` service not
    starting.

    The next minimum required version of libvirt to be used in a future
    release is 8.0.0, while the next minimum QEMU is 6.2.0.
