    The 2.92 microversion makes the following changes:

    * Make public_key a mandatory parameter for keypair creation. This means
      that by this microversion, Nova will stop to support automatic keypair
      generations. Only imports will be possible.
    * Allow 2 new special characters: '@' and '.' (dot),
      in addition to the existing constraints of ``[a-z][A-Z][0-9][_- ]``
