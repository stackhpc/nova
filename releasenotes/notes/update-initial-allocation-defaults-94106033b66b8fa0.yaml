    In this release the default values for the initial ram and cpu allocation
    ratios have been updated to 1.0 and 4.0 respectively. This will not
    affect any existing compute node resource providers but the new default
    will take effect on the creation of new resource providers.

    The default initial allocation ratios enabled ram over commit by default
    with a factor of ``1.5``. This value was chosen early in nova's history
    as the predominant workload was web hosting or other light weight
    virtualization. Similarly the default initial cpu allocation ratio
    defaulted to 16. As more demanding workload from telco, enterprise,
    scientific and governmental users became the norm the initial values we
    had chosen became less and less correct overtime. These have now been
    updated to reflect a more reasonable default for the majority of our users.
    As of this release the initial ram allocation value is 1.0 disabling
    overcommit by default for new compute nodes and the initial cpu allocation
    ratio is now 4.0 which is a more reasonable overcommit for non idle
    workloads.
