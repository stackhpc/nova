upgrade:
  - |
    The default ``api-paste.ini`` file has been updated and now the Metadata
    API pipeline includes the ``HTTPProxyToWSGI`` middleware.

deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[api] use_forwarded_for`` parameter has been deprecated. Instead of
    using this parameter, add the ``HTTPProxyToWSGI`` middleware to api
    pipelines, and ``[oslo_middleware] enable_proxy_headers_parsing = True``
    to nova.conf.
