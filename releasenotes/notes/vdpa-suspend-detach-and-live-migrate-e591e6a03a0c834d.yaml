    vDPA support was first introduced in the 23.0.0 (Wallaby)
    release with limited instance lifecycle operations. Nova now supports
    all instance lifecycle operations including suspend, attach/detach
    and hot-plug live migration.

    QEMU and the Linux kernel do not currently support transparent
    live migration of vDPA devices at this time. Hot-plug live migration
    unplugs the VDPA device on the source host before the VM is live migrated
    and automatically hot-plugs the device on the destination after the
    migration. While this can lead to packet loss it enable live migration
    to be used when needed until transparent live migration can be added
    in a future release.

    VDPA Hot-plug live migration requires all compute services to be upgraded
    to service level 63 to be enabled. Similarly suspend resume need service
    level 63 and attach/detach require service level 62.
    As such it will not be available to use during a rolling upgrade but will
    become available when all host are upgraded to the 26.0.0 (Zed) release.

    With the addition of these features, all instance lifecycle operations are
    now valid for VMs with VDPA neutron ports.
