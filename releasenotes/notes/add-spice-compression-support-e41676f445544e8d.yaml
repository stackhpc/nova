    The following SPICE-related options are added to the ``spice``
    configuration group of a Nova configuration:

    - ``image_compression``
    - ``jpeg_compression``
    - ``zlib_compression``
    - ``playback_compression``
    - ``streaming_mode``

    These configuration options can be used to enable and set the
    SPICE compression settings for libvirt (QEMU/KVM) provisioned
    instances. Each configuration option is optional and can be set
    explicitly to configure the associated SPICE compression setting
    for libvirt. If all configuration options are not set, then none
    of the SPICE compression settings will be configured for libvirt,
    which corresponds to the behavior before this change. In this case,
    the built-in defaults from the libvirt backend (e.g. QEMU) are used.

    Note that those options are only taken into account if SPICE support
    is enabled (and the VNC support is disabled).
