    The 2.94 microversion has been added. This microversion extends
    microversion 2.90 by allowing Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) wherever
    the ``hostname`` is able to be specified. This consists of creating an
    instance (``POST /servers``), updating an instance
    (``PUT /servers/{id}``), or rebuilding an instance
    (``POST /servers/{server_id}/action (rebuild)``). When using an FQDN as the
    instance hostname, the ``[api]dhcp_domain`` configuration option must be
    set to the empty string in order for the correct FQDN to appear in the
    ``hostname`` field in the metadata API.

    In order to make use of microversion's 2.94 FQDN hostnames, the
    ``[api]dhcp_domain`` config option must be set to the empty string. If
    this is not done, the ``hostname`` field in the metadata API will be
    incorrect, as it will include the value of ``[api]dhcp_domain`` appended to
    the instance's FQDN. Note that simply not setting ``[api]dhcp_domain`` is
    not enough, as it has a default value of ``novalocal``. It must explicitly
    be set to the empty string.
