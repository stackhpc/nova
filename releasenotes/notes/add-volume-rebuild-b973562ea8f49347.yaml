    Added support for rebuilding a volume-backed instance with a different
    image. This is achieved by reimaging the boot volume i.e. writing new
    image on the boot volume at cinder side.
    Previously rebuilding volume-backed instances with same image was
    possible but this feature allows rebuilding volume-backed instances
    with a different image than the existing one in the boot volume.
    This is supported starting from API microversion 2.93.
