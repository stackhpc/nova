    A new `num_instances_weigher` weigher has been added. This weigher will
    compare the number of instances between each node and order the list of
    filtered results by its number, By default, this weigher is enabled but with
    a default of 0.0 which doesn't change the current behavior.
    In order to use it, please change the value of
    ``[filter_scheduler]/num_instances_weight_multiplier`` config option where
    a positive value will favor the host with the higher number of instances
    (ie. packing strategy) vs. a negative value that will spread instances
    between hosts. As a side note, this weigher will count *all* of the existing
    instances on the host, even the stopped or shelved ones.
