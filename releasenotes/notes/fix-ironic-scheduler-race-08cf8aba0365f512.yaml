    Fixed when placement returns ironic nodes that have just started automatic
    cleaning as possible valid candidates. This is done by marking all ironic
    nodes with an instance on them as reserved, such that nova only makes them
    available once we have double checked Ironic reports the node as available.
    If you don't have automatic cleaning on, this might mean it takes longer
    than normal for Ironic nodes to become available for new instances.
    If you want the old behaviour use the following workaround config:
    `[workarounds]skip_reserve_in_use_ironic_nodes=true`
