deprecations:
  - |
    We have renamed ``[ironic]partition_key`` to ``[ironic]conductor_group``.
    The config option is still used to specify which Ironic conductor group
    the ironic driver in the nova compute process should target.
  - |
    We have deprecated the configuration ``[ironic]peer_list``, along with
    our support for a group of ironic nova-compute processes targeting
    a shared set of Ironic nodes.
    There are so many bugs in this support we now prefer statically
    sharding the nodes between multiple nova-compute processes.
    Note that the ironic nova-compute process is stateless, and the
    identity of the service is defined by the config option ``[DEFAULT]host``.
    As such, you can use an active-passive HA solution to ensure at most
    one nova-compute process is running for each Ironic node shard.
