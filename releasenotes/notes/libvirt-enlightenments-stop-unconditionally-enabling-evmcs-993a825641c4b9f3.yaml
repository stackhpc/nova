    Bug 2009280 has been fixed by no longer enabling the evmcs enlightenment in
    the libvirt driver. evmcs only works on Intel CPUs, and domains with that
    enlightenment cannot be started on AMD hosts. There is a possible future
    feature to enable support for generating this enlightenment only when
    running on Intel hosts.
