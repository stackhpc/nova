    During the triage of https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1978372
    we compared the performance of nova's numa allocations strategies
    as it applied to the large numbers of host and guest numa nodes.
    Prior to ``Xena`` nova only supported a linear packing strategy.
    In ``Xena`` ``[compute]/packing_host_numa_cells_allocation_strategy``
    was introduced maintaining the previous packing behavior by default.
    The numa allocation strategy has now been defaulted to spread.
    The old behavior can be restored by defining:
    ``[compute]/packing_host_numa_cells_allocation_strategy=true``
