    With the change from ml2/ovs DHCP agents towards OVN implementation
    in neutron there is no port with device_owner ``network:dhcp`` anymore.
    Instead DHCP is provided by ``network:distributed`` port.
    Fix relies on enable_dhcp provided by neutron-api if no port with
    ``network:dhcp`` owner is found. See `bug 2055245
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2055245>`__ for details.
