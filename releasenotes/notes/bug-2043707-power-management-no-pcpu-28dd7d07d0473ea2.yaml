    Relaxed the config option checking of the cpu_power_management feature of
    the libvirt driver. The nova-compute service will start with
    [libvirt]cpu_power_management=True and an empty [compute]cpu_dedicated_set
    configuration. The power management is still only applied to dedicated CPUs.
    So the above configuration only allowed to ensure that cpu_power_management
    can be enabled independently for configuring cpu_dedicated_set during
    deployment.
