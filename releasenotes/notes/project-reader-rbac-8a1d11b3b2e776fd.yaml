    The Nova policies have been modified to drop the system scope. Every
    API policy is scoped to project. This means that system scoped users
    will get 403 permission denied error.

    Also, the project reader role is ready to use. Users with reader role
    can only perform the read-only operations within their project. This
    role can be used for the audit purposes.

    Currently, nova supports the following roles:

    * ``admin`` (Legacy admin)
    * ``project member``
    * ``project reader``

    For the details on what changed from the existing policy, please refer
    to the `RBAC new guidelines`_. We have implemented only phase-1 of the
    `RBAC new guidelines`_.
    Currently, scope checks and new defaults are disabled by default. You can
    enable them by switching the below config option in ``nova.conf`` file::

      [oslo_policy]
      enforce_new_defaults=True
      enforce_scope=True

    We recommend to enable the both scope as well new defaults together
    otherwise you may experience some late failures with unclear error
    messages.

    Please refer `Policy New Defaults`_ for detail about policy new defaults
    and migration plan.
