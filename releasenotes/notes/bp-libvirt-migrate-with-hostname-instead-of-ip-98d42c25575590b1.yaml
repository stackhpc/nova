    The new config option ``[libvirt]migration_inbound_addr`` is now used to
    determine the address for incoming move operations (cold migrate, resize,
    evacuate). This config is defaulted to [DEFAULT]my_ip to keep the
    configuration backward compatible. However it allows an explicit hostname
    or FQDN to be specified, or allows to specify '%s' that is then resolved to
    the hostname of compute host.
    Note that this config should only be changed from its default after every
    compute is upgraded.
