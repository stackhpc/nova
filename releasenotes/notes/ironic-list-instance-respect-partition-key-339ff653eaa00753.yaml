fixes:
  - Ironic virt driver now uses the node cache and respects partition keys,
    such as conductor group, for list_instances and list_instance_uuids calls.
    This fix will improve performance of the periodic queries which use these
    driver methods and reduce API and DB load on the backing Ironic service.
