    The ``AvailabilityZoneFilter`` was deprecated for removal
    in 24.0.0 (Xena) and has now been removed.
    The functionality of the``AvailabilityZoneFilter`` has been
    replaced by the``map_az_to_placement_aggregate`` pre-filter.
    The  pre-filter was introduced in 18.0.0 (Rocky) and enabled
    by default in 24.0.0 (Xena). This pre-filter is now always
    enabled and the ``[scheduler] query_placement_for_availability_zone``
    config option has been removed.
