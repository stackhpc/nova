    Starting with v2.95 any evacuated instance will be stopped at
    destination. The required minimum version for Nova computes is
    27.0.0 (antelope 2023.1).  Operator can still continue using
    previous behavior by selecting microversion below v2.95.

    Operators will have to consider upgrading compute hosts to Nova
    27.0.0 (antelope 2023.1) in order to take advantage of the new
    (microversion v2.95) evacuate API behavior. An exception will be
    raised for older versions.
