    This is now possible to configure nova-compute services using libvirt driver
    by setting ``[libvirt]cpu_power_management`` to ``True`` in order to let the
    service to powering down or up physical CPUs depending on whether those CPUs
    are pinned or not to instances. In order on to support this feature, the
    compute service needs to be set with ``[compute]cpu_dedicated_set``. If so,
    all the related CPUs will be powering down until they are used by an
    instance where the related pinned CPU will be powering up just before
    starting the guest. If ``[compute]cpu_dedicated_set`` isn't set, then the
    compute service will refuse to start.
    By default the power strategy will offline CPUs when powering down and
    online the CPUs on powering up but another strategy is possible by using
    ``[libvirt]cpu_power_management_strategy=governor`` which will rather modify
    the related CPU governor using ``[libvirt]cpu_power_governor_low`` and
    ``[libvirt]cpu_power_governor_high`` configuration values (respective
    defaults being  ``powersave`` and ``performance``)
