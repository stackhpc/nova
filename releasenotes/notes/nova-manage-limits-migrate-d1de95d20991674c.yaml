    A new command ``nova-manage limits migrate_to_unified_limits`` has been
    added to make migration from the ``nova.quota.DbQuotaDriver`` to the
    ``nova.quota.UnifiedLimitsDriver`` easier. This will enable operators to
    have their existing quota limits copied from the Nova database to Keystone
    automatically.
