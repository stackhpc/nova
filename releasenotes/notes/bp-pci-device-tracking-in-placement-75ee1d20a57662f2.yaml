    Nova started tracking PCI devices in Placement. This is an optional feature
    disabled by default while we are implementing inventory tracking and
    scheduling support for both PCI passthrough devices and SR-IOV devices
    consumed via Neutron ports. Please read our
    `documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/pci-passthrough.html#pci-tracking-in-placement>`_
    for more details on what is supported how this feature can be enabled.
